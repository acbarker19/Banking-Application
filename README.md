# Banking Application
A simple banking application project from my second programming class, Programming and Problem Solving II, at the University of Mount Union that was taught by Dr. James Klayder.

Some prototype frames and code was provided by Dr. James Klayder and the project itself was created by a group consisting of Alec Barker, Jarrod Luca, and Cierra Roller. Some helper files are used that were created for Princeton University's CS department.

It is a simple banking application with two types of users, admins and regular users.
- Admins can search for users and either deposit or withdraw money from any account. The admin has a special frame to edit the accounts. They can search by username, and deposit or withdraw from the list of users. For example, if the admin searches for usernames starting with "j" and deposits $10, every account that starts with "j" will get $10.
- Regular users can log in and only deposit or withdraw money into their own accounts.

The admin account is:
- Username: admin
- Password: admin

One of the regular user accounts is:
- Username: jsmith
- Password: smith

Other regular user accounts can be found in helpers/data.txt
